## 👋 Hi there!

### 👩‍💻 About Me

I’m Eva, a student-athlete currently studying **Statistics** at **Harvard College**!

🎓 Academically, I’m interested in topics like **predictive analysis**, **probabilities**, and **computer science**. In light of the recent spikes in cryptocurrency prices, I’m currently diving into a personal project to apply **machine learning** to predict crypto trends. It’s a volatile topic, so I’m not sure how it’ll behave — but I’m excited to test it out and see what I learn. 😊

🚣 Outside tech, I enjoy pretty much anything that is active, especially rowing! I am member of the **Varsity Lightweight Rowing Team** at Harvard. I also like to run, lift, and just be outside. I am also a massive foodie that loves trying cool new places.

📚 When it comes to reading, I gravitate toward books on **strategy**, **self-improvement**, and **analytical thinking**, with a soft spot for **historical fiction**.  
Most recently, I read:  
• *[Decision-Driven Analytics: Leveraging Human Intelligence to Unlock the Power of Data](https://www.amazon.com/Decision-Driven-Analytics-Leveraging-Intelligence-Unlock/dp/1613631715)* by Bart De Langhe and Stefano Puntoni

🌍 I love traveling as well! 🇧🇬 🇫🇷 🇧🇸 🇬🇹 🇹🇨 🇨🇦
