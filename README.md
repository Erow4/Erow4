## Hi there 👋

### 🚀 About Me

👩‍💻 I’m *Eva Harris*, a student-athlete currently studying statistics at Harvard College. I’m passionate about solving real-world problems using .

🎓 Academically, I’m deeply interested in topics like predictive analysis, probabilities, and computer science. In light of the recent flux in cryptocurrency prices, I’m currently diving into a personal project to apply ML to predict crypto trends. It is a topic that has a lot of volitility, so I am unsure about how it will behave. Nonetheless, I am testing it out because I'm curious about how it will perform :)

✍🚣 Outside tech, I enjoy pretty much anything that is active, especially rowing! I am member of the Varsity Lightweight Rowing team at Harvard. I also like to run, lift, and just be outside. I am also an absurd foodie that loves trying cool new places.

📚 In terms of personal reading, I generally like to read books on strategy, self-improvement, and analysis. I always have a soft spot for historical fiction. Most recently I have read:  
• *Decision-Driven Analytics: Leveraging Human Intelligence to Unlock the Power of Data* by Bart De Langhe, Stefano Puntoni
