## 👋 Hi there!

### 👩‍💻 About Me

I’m Eva, a student-athlete currently studying **Statistics** at **Harvard College**!

🎓 Academically, I’m deeply interested in topics like **predictive analysis**, **probabilities**, and **computer science**. In light of the recent flux in cryptocurrency prices, I’m currently diving into a personal project to apply **machine learning** to predict crypto trends. It’s a volatile topic, so I’m not sure how it’ll behave — but I’m excited to test it out and see what I learn. 😊

✍🚣 Outside tech, I enjoy pretty much anything active — especially rowing! I’m a member of the **Varsity Lightweight Rowing Team** at Harvard. I also love to run, lift, and spend time outdoors. Bonus fact: I’m a total foodie who’s always on the hunt for new spots to try!

📚 When it comes to reading, I gravitate toward books on **strategy**, **self-improvement**, and **analytical thinking**, with a soft spot for **historical fiction**.  
Most recently, I read:  
• *[Decision-Driven Analytics: Leveraging Human Intelligence to Unlock the Power of Data](https://www.amazon.com/Decision-Driven-Analytics-Leveraging-Intelligence-Unlock/dp/1613631715)* by Bart De Langhe and Stefano Puntoni

🌍 I love traveling! I’ve been to 6 countries so far: 🇧🇬 Bulgaria, 🇫🇷 France, 🇧🇸 Bahamas, 🇬🇹 Guatemala, 🇹🇨 Turks and Caicos, 🇨🇦 Canada
